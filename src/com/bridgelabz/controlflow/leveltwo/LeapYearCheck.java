//todo : Write a LeapYear program that takes a year as input and outputs the Year is a Leap Year or not a Leap Year. 
//! Hint => 
//! The LeapYear program only works for year >= 1582, corresponding to a year in the Gregorian calendar. So ensure to check for the same. 
//! Further, the Leap Year is a Year divisible by 4 and not 100 unless it is divisible by 400. E.g. 1800 is not a Leap Year and 2000 is a Leap Year.
//! Write code having multiple if else statements based on conditions provided above and a second part having only one if statement and multiple logical
