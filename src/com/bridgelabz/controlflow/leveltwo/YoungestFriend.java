//todo : Create a program to find the youngest friends among 3 Amar, Akbar, and Anthony based on their ages and the tallest among the friends based on their heights
//! Hint => 
//! Take user input for the age and height of the 3 friends and store it in a variable
//! Find the smallest of the 3 ages to find the youngest friend and display it
//! Find the largest of the 3 heights to find the tallest friend and display it
