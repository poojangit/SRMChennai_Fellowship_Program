//Create a program to find the factors of a number taken as user input, store the factors in an array and display the factors. Also find the sum, sum of square of factors and product of the factors and display the results
//Hint => 
//Take the input for a number

//To find factors and save to array will have two loops. The first loop to find the count and initialize the array with the count. And the second loop save the factors into the array
//Write a method to find the sum of the factors using factors array
//Write a method to find the product of the factors using factors array
//Write a method to find the sum of square of the factors using Math.pow() method
