//Create a program to find the shortest, tallest, and mean height of players present in a football team.
//Hint => 
//The formula to calculate the mean is: mean = sum of all elements/number of elements
//Create an int array named heights of size 11 and get 3 digits random height in cms for each player in the range 150 cms to 250 cms
//Write the method to Find the sum of all the elements present in the array.
//Write the method to find the mean height of the players on the football team
//Write the method to find the shortest height of the players on the football team 
//Write the method to find the tallest height of the players on the football team
//Finally display the results
